# ImagePicker-Android

This ImagePicker Library for android can be used to pick images either from camera or gallery. This library enforces you to implement file provider so that your app will work in Nougat (Android 7) as well as previous versions of android without any issues. No need to handle required permessions explicitly (like storage or camera permission). This Library currently works for single image picker, multiple image selection is under progress..

# Gradle Dependency

### Repository

The Gradle dependency is available via [jCenter](https://bintray.com/swetabh-suman/ImagePicker/imagepicker).
jCenter is the default Maven repository used by Android Studio.

The minimum API level supported by this library is API 16 (JellyBean).

```gradle
dependencies {
	// ... other dependencies here
    compile 'com.swetabh.imagepicker:imagepicker:0.1.0'
}
```

# Creating File Provider

For more recent apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher, passing a file:// URI across a package boundary causes a [FileUriExposedException](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/FileUriExposedException.html). Therefore, we are now using more generic way of storing images using a FileProvider.

This is how you can configure your FileProvider. In your app's manifest, add a provider to your application:

```xml
<application>
   ...
   <provider
        android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
        android:authorities="@string/authorities"
        android:exported="false"
        android:grantUriPermissions="true">
        <meta-data
            android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
            android:resource="@xml/file_paths"></meta-data>
    </provider>
    ...
</application>
```

Make sure that the authorities string matches with the string you are passing to constructor of library as follow. It would be better to store authorities string in strings.xml file to reduce the conflicts. 

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="authorities">com.example.android.fileprovider</string>
</resources
```

```java
ImagePicker picker = new ImagePicker(MainActivity.this, R.string.authorities);
```

In the meta-data section of the provider definition, you can see that the provider expects eligible paths to be configured in a dedicated resource file, res/xml/file_paths.xml. Here is the content required for this particular example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-path name="my_images" path="Android/data/com.example.package.name/files/Pictures" />
</paths>
```

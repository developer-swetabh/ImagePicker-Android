# ImagePicker-Android

This ImagePicker Library for android can be used to pick images either from camera or gallery. This library enforces you to implement file provider so that your app will work in Nougat (Android 7) as well as previous versions of android without any issues. No need to handle required permessions explicitly (like storage or camera permission). This Library currently works for single image picker, multiple image selection is under progress..

# Gradle Dependency

### Repository

The Gradle dependency is available via [jCenter](https://bintray.com/swetabh-suman/ImagePicker/imagepicker).
jCenter is the default Maven repository used by Android Studio.

The minimum API level supported by this library is API 16 (JellyBean).

```gradle
dependencies {
	// ... other dependencies here
    compile 'com.swetabh.imagepicker:imagepicker:0.1.0'
}
```
# Using ImagePicker Library

### Initializing the library

For start using the ImagePicker library, First you need to add the dependency as shown above. Right after that, In your activity first you need to create the Object of ImagePicker class.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    public ImagePicker mImagePicker;
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_home);
	//Initialize here with context and string for authorities
	mImagePicker = new ImagePicker(MainActivity.this, "Your Authorities String");
    }
}
```

### Using the Library

Now you can use the mImagePicker object to use the library as shown below.

For Camera..

```java
private void pickFromCamera() {
	mImagePicker.pickImageFromCamera();
}
```

For Gallery..

```java
private void pickFromGallery() {
	mImagePicker.pickImageFromGallery();
}
```

### Getting the Result

For getting the results or the path of the image you have selected, you should override the Activity's `onActivityResult()` as shown below..

```java
@Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        String imagePath = mImagePicker.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        
        if(imagePath != null){
		Log.d("PickedImagePath", imagePath);
	}
	
	//use imagePath variable to show image
	
    }
```

# Creating File Provider

For more recent apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher, passing a file:// URI across a package boundary causes a [FileUriExposedException](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/FileUriExposedException.html). Therefore, we are now using more generic way of storing images using a [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html).

This is how you can configure your [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html). In your app's `Manifest`, add a provider to your application:

```xml
<application>
   ...
   <provider
        android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
        android:authorities="@string/authorities"
        android:exported="false"
        android:grantUriPermissions="true">
        <meta-data
            android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
            android:resource="@xml/file_paths"></meta-data>
    </provider>
    ...
</application>
```

Make sure that the authorities string matches with the string you are passing to constructor of library as follow. It would be better to store authorities string in `strings.xml` file to reduce the conflicts. 

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="authorities">com.example.android.fileprovider</string>
</resources
```

```java
ImagePicker picker = new ImagePicker(MainActivity.this, R.string.authorities);
```

In the meta-data section of the provider definition, you can see that the provider expects eligible paths to be configured in a dedicated resource file, `res/xml/file_paths.xml`. Here is the content required for this particular example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-path name="my_images" path="Android/data/com.example.package.name/files/Pictures" />
</paths>
```

For more detail on how to create a file provider, you can refer [Google's Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html)
